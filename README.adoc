== DayCaptain's REST API

https://daycaptain.com[DayCaptain^] offers a REST API to manager a user's information objects.

The API is usable with any technology that supports HTTP.

An example call that creates a new day task looks as follows (with `curl`):

----
curl 'https://daycaptain.com/2021-12-31/tasks' \
  -XPOST -i \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"string":"Hello Captain"}'
----

=== Authentication

To authenticate your user in the API calls, you have to include a `Bearer` token.

You generate a token in your https://daycaptain.com/account.html[user account^] (`G+X`) under the section _API Tokens_.
The generated token is used as the `Bearer` token in the `Authorization` HTTP header, as seen above.

*Example:*

"Your token: `123[..]abc` " + 
will be included as `-H "Authorization: Bearer 123[..]abc"` in your HTTP call.
